R Shiny application that allows for testing of multiple imputation, normalisation and differential abundance analysis methods for proteomics data.

The application requires to input files:
1. Protein groups identification file
2. Metadata file

The differentially abundant proteins can be further analysed in the app using clusterProfiler, rrvgo and DOSE packages to define their implication (Over-Representation Analysis - ORA) in different GO Biological Processeses, Molecular Functions, Cellular Components and Disease.
